Frosty Flake Controller
===

This is the firmware for Rev. 20140521 of the Frosty Flake controller by [Bathroom Epiphanies](http://bathroomepiphanies.com/controllers/), a replacement controller for the [Cooler Master Quick Fire Rapid](http://www.coolermaster.com/peripheral/keyboards/quickfirerapid/).

The code was adapted from the [BathroomEpiphanies TMK Firmware](https://github.com/BathroomEpiphanies/epiphanies_tmk_keyboard/tree/master/be_controllers), but has been cleaned up to match the [schematic](https://deskthority.net/wiki/File:Frosty_Flake_Schematics.pdf) and gone through some minor refactoring for QMK.
